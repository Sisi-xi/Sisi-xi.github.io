This project is my first trial on Computer Vision. We utilize [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) to help detect human faces and then add different filters to the faces.

Our facial filter have three versions:

1.  Static: image input to image output with the selected facial filter
2.  Real-time: real-time demo with several facial filters to choose from
3.  Telegram bot: implement static version on telegram

I am responsible for the coding part and the poster design.
