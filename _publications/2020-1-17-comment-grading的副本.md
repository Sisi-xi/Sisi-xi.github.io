This project is a group project for Machine Learning course. It is intended to automatically do rib fracture detection, trying to circle out fractures in radiographs with high confidence.

I was responsible for the data processing part, since rib fracture images often need data augmentation to better distinguish the fractures.

[Here](https://sisi-xi.github.io/files/fracture.pdf) is our final report.
